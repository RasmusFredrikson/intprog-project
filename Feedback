-------TODO----------

-------Prio 1 (Easy) -------
- Use some “you won” animation instead of displaying an alert after the battle is over. ()
- Add text or a message saying that you are waiting for an opponent if no one has chosen the other player. ()
- Add button to abort battle ()


-------Prio 2 (Quite easy) -------
- You could also add some information about the different attacks (what do they do and how much damage do they cause). ()
- Skills of Pokemon or few other required features of Pokemon during the battle can be displayed in the sidebar or just text with bullet points inside the battle view. ()
- Provide some information about how to play and how many attacks you get to make in one turn, when its over etc.. ()
- It would be really cool if you could make some animations when they are attacked (sprites). ()
- Have the HP both as a number and as a bar. ()
- I would also like a lot of more information on the other player. maybe a console view or something so that I can see that the other player has connected, or that the other player is waiting for me to pick my pokemon. ()
- Fix ng-click on home screen.


-------Prio 3 (Difficult) -------
- Is there a limit for how many pokémon you can bring to battle? What happens if player two chooses a different amount of pokémon than you do?
What's the point of the game? Whats happens when you win a match?  ()

- What happens when a pokemon dies (or faints)? Does the other pokemon in your list get swapped in? I assume as much, but maybe in the view before the battle, you could change the order of the pokemon, and also maybe have a lot more info about them (stats, attacks, etc). ()


---------Not Prioritized (Very difficult) --------

- The interaction between the players can be provided by an exchange of stickers just like in hike or messenger. ()
- You could implement a login-system and some kind of elosystem where you can see your and your friends ranks. ()


---------Completed-----------

- You could also use images for “fire” and “water” instead of text to make the interface look better. (X)
- Indicate whose turn it is to attack (X)
- Also while choosing a pokemon, I could not find an option to cancel the selection. (X)
- The choose player screen is quite empty, think about whether that small window needs a separate page, or if you can implement it as a kind of drop down meny in the navbar. (X)
- The placement of logos can be put in a grid better, the non uniform fashion(that is just aesthetics and can be fixed at a later stage as well. (X)
- Add some avatar picture to the pokemons in the “My pokémons” list to the left. (X)
- I could not find which player I was choosing for(after choosing player 1 on first screen) (X)
